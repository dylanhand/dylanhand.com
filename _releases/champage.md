Check  
Fetch me a glass of champagne  
You people looking like you having a day  
We bask in the shade while they grasp for the fame  
You looking like asshats with a capital A  
Uh, yeah we came here to get this  
What the fuck y'all doin better turn this up  
Who you playing with  
Nobody better there ain't no debating it it  
Look look wow I'm amazing  
You mis mis took took what I was saying  
I'm taking the path that's lacking the pavement  
You running laps on a track where it's safest huh  

Walk in looking like God with the drip drip  
Givin' all y'all handshakes with a limp wrist  
Y'all know I'm the bomb with the tick-tick boom  
Goin' goin' gone all the distance  
Funny that I wished for it now this is it  
Replaced inhibition with some discipline  
And now we out riskin' shit  
And it sounds better than the top ten percent, uh  

Yeah a lot of people in their own way  
But we all gon' go away in the end  
So it don't make any sense don't wait  
Get a grip show face live a bit  
Don't wait for the shit to come to you  
'cause it isn't gonna do that no  
I'm in the pool with a couple of cool cats though  
In the booth I gotta fuckin' cool rap flow  
What it do, I'm gonna gonna gonna what  
Pop in with it gitta go with a ga'  
Asto dibidigo wit a ga' ga' goo  
Petta kitty co with a ca'  
Duh dough but I'm gonna  
'cause I 'cause I 'cause I 'cause I  

Walk in looking like God with the drip drip  
Givin' all y'all handshakes with a limp wrist  
Y'all know I'm the bomb with the tick-tick boom  
Goin' goin' gone all the distance  
Funny that I wish for it now this is it  
Replaced inhibition with some discipline  
And now we out riskin' shit  
And it's sounding better than the top ten percent  
Hwaugh
