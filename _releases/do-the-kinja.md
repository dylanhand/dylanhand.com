Yeah, yeah we got a couple crises  
Sea levels and anxiety rising  
Relationships, we replacing them with a bright screen  
'Cause these like are enticing  
I think we can do better than this  
Get rid of the grip we got on the pettiest shit  
While we're all tryna get that competitive edge  
We forget to pay attention to us and our friends (true)  
Yeah it's a bad state of the planet  
In 12 years it's irreversable damage (damn)  
But man, if we change our habits  
Our kids'll be given a place to inhabit  
  
It's our planet  
And it's our home  
Do the kinja  
It's our home, it's our planet  
There's no planet B  
  
Kinja

So we dedicated to improving it  
Now who is with us to be the solution  
All you gotta do is be a kind human
