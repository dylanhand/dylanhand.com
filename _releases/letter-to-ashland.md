Yeah  
Yeah  
Last night I had a dream about Ashland  
Showed up and saw people that I haven't in  
A while, then I missed the flight that's taking me back again  
First panicked then realized I'm with fam and friends  
Made me look at life and examine it  
Like am I doing this right? Am I managin'?  
Should seeds stay in the town parents plant 'em in  
Or is it okay for them to stray to new land instead?  
It's not abandonment  
It's just a pandemic hit and so I can't travel yet  
When restrictions are lifted, you know I'll be back again  
You know I'll be back again  
'Til then I'll be chillin' with a mask and a wish  
When the vaccin' is finished I'm packin' my shit  
and I'm grabbin' a lift to the airport  
Be prepared for it; I'll be there for that visit  
Yeah  
I'll be there for that visit  
Right  
You know I'll be there for that visit  

I really miss you motherfuckers back home  
It's been too long  

I grew rooted in Oregon  
A small slice of the globe, went to see more of it  
Pouring in Portland so I crossed the border  
Costa Rica shore, met a girl and she's gorgeous  
I'm feeling pretty sure of it  
She became the one I'm touring with  
Funny how one trip opened the door to this  
But I still miss  
All my people back home and I still wish  
That I could be back home at least each six  
Months but that's been tough 'cause COVID  
Is makin' its way around the globe instead  
But once that's done I'ma jet  
I'ma get on the next flight and be back home  
Didn't think it would be this long  
When I leave better leave that door open  
I'ma be back to see y'all more  
Yeah  
I'ma be back to see y'all more  
Right  
I'ma be back to see y'all more  
Yeah!
