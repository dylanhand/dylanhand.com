Yeah, uh  
We not afraid  
To rock the boat  
Feelin' inflated  
We oughta float  
Seed planted  
About to grow  
I knew I had it  
Feel unstoppable  
I came to get it again I'm about to pop off  
I used to keep it contained, then I let the top off  
They all be average I be pouring the passion in  
I don't know what the faffin' is all about  
I be snappin' di-di-di-di-di-di-did he do it?  
I think he mighta did  
That engine got every single cylinder firin'  
Tires spinnin' I ain't gonna hold steady  
I be building moment-y  
All I hear is "go" that's a code ready  
Whoo! I'm comin' to give it the gusto  
They thought was just a phase  
And I'm gonna deliver the utmost  
Then I'm gonna pick up the pace  
I be goin' a hundred and some so  
They all get blown away  
Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay  
Feel like I'm at the top of the globe  
What Everest they say   
It is not gonna stop the approach  
I develop from negatives, they F-stop and expose  
That they ain't even in the picture  
Like I'm croppin' a photo, let's go  

We not afraid  
To rock the boat  
Feelin' inflated  
We oughta float  
Seed planted  
About to grow  
I knew I had it  
Feel unstoppable  

We not afraid  
To rock the boat  
We not afraid  
To rock the boat  
We not afraid  
To rock the boat  
I knew I had it  
Feel unstoppable
