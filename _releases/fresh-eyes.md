Uh, yeah  

Stayin' loose on a tight rope  
Fresh eyes, no blindfold  
How you gonna use your time though  
Put the work in and you'll find gold  

You can feel it in the air right?  
This right here feel like paradise  
Didn't use to now I dare to try  
Never take a break, ain't a chair in sight  
Had a pair of fights and  
I won both of 'em  
Had to check the mirror to find  
Who the opponent was  
Held it back since I had opposing thumbs  
Now don't give a fuck  
Not a solitary modicum  
And there's more to come  
Some people were born to run  
I was born to make order from  
The words as drums  
While someone strum a chord and hum  
And do it right, not a corner cut  
Uh, I'm closing loops as I open up  
Digging holes in my goals  
Gotta go for 'em  
They chasin' bread, hell me too it's true  
But I'm so hot that it's toast that comes  

Stayin' loose on a tight rope  
Fresh eyes, no blindfold  
How you gonna use your time though  
Put the work in and you'll find gold  
Yeah, stayin' loose on a tight rope  
Fresh eyes, no blindfold  
How you gonna use your time though  
Put the work in and you'll find gold  

This type of feeling got me some way  
Steered clear now I peer into fear's face  
Won't run away, won't just wait  
If I don't try nothing's gonna change  
Now hail, sleet, sun, or rain I'ma show up  
I'ma chip away 'til my face on the totem  
At war 'til I got a wage I can fold up  
And hold up a toast 'til we go nuts  
Rose up out of the basement  
These other acts just complain but  
They're coming plain  
They take another hit, I'm just one away  
Gotta chase 'til I'm center stage  
Start slow then blow, got it planned out  
While they sittin' in, I stand out  
I step it up, they starting to stare now  
Got you listenin' to Dylan Hand now, yeah  

Stayin' loose on a tight rope  
Fresh eyes, no blindfold  
How you gonna use your time though  
Put the work in and you'll find gold  
Yeah, stayin' loose on a tight rope  
Fresh eyes, no blindfold  
How you gonna use your time though  
Put the work in and you'll find gold
