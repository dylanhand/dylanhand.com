Uh uh, uh uh  
Check  
Uhuuu (uhuuu)  
You got it, you got it  
Uh  
  
Feel like a kid again  
Shit I used to day dream 'bout, now we living it  
Sticking with it 'til it's brilliant  
So you know success is imminent  
I don't need your benefit of the doubt  
We wrecking it now, we rolling  
Head in the clouds is leverage now, we floating  
Lot of 'em they their head in a cage  
They won't chance it they're set in their ways  
They won't change got a  
Long spoon to stir the pot of the basic  
Some hard proof to show I'm part the equation  
I throw the bat and now I'm lapping the bases  
I ain't lacking the patience I'll be back in a day bitch  
  
Yeah and that's that then  
Woohf  
And you know it's madness  
Went from average to savage and walked away laughing  
Cus now this shit is all automatic  
  
It's automatic  
Yeah  
Right  
It's all automatic  
Uh  
It's automatic  
Check, yeah  
  
I'm something they didn't expect  
Coming up from the distance  
Holy shit and they're impressed (wow)  
Said I'm gonna do it then I made the change  
Won't wait for them to pave a lane  
I be  
In the zone again to get it I'm approaching it  
While you just scroll your phone until they roll the credits  
So pathetic only guess is that they gon' regret it  
I'ma go the distance til I'm out the solar system bitches  
Til it's stone it's set in  
Yeah you know that this is what I wanted  
Woke and got to it soon as I got out of the bed  
While they slept I was prepped I work hard to the edge  
Took a shot in the dark and I hit the target instead, I'm the best  
No time for being humble feeling cocky now  
Feel like nobody could stop me now  
Or knock me down a peg you all just walk around and beg  
I be getting carried away and now it's clear I have a place  
You ain't gon' talk me down  
  
Went from average to savage  
And walked away laughing  
Cus now this shit is all automatic  
  
It's automatic  
Right?  
It's all automatic  
It's automatic  
  
It's all all automatic  
This shit just gettin' crazier and crazier right now  
I mean I just woke up like this this morning you know?  
Nobody touching the flow  
Itâ€™s Dylan Hand you know  
We'll be back in a minute  
Haow!
