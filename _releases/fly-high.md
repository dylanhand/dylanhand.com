Yeah  
Plenty days staying stuck in the head  
Ruminating on the ways that it could have been better  
Instead of being present. Easier said than done  
But I think that it’s time to switch this up  
‘Cause that shit’s not working. It’s all wasted energy  
We all want a remedy, we’re all tryna let it be  
We all want to be set free from what’s holding us back  
Convinced we can’t when we know that we can. Damn  
Fuck that though, it’s time to fly high  
High above the self-doubt, high above the bad vibes  
High above the bullshit we’ve got in our minds  
High above the “fuck this though, I’m not gonna try”  
Feeling withered and remembering the days when we were killing this shit  
Time to divorce the past that we’re living in  
Instead we’re gonna climb and find a bird’s-eye view  
‘Cause we’ve had enough of this shit so it’s time to  
  
Fly high, fly high  
(That’s right we’re gonna)  
Fly high, fly high  
(Yup. We gotta)  
  
Fly high, fly high (we’re tryna fly high with the birds now)  
(Okay, yeah)  
Fly high, fly high (we’re tryna fly high with the birds now)  
  
Many days feeling under this pressure  
To muster up effort to finish stuff that was left at  
80 percent but keeps getting postponed  
We tell ourselves we’ll do it later though  
We’ve all got dreams we want to see accomplished and projects   
We want to see more than just started; we want to flourish  
But we’ve gotten in this habit of procrastinating   
And making very little progress. Ah, shit  
Fuck that though it’s time to fly high  
High above distractions, excuses, and those lies  
High above the quick fixes keeping us blind  
To the big picture vision that we’d clearly defined  
It appears that the time won’t ever come  
Toss the fear to the side and give it a try  
I’m serious, why would you wait another minute? Now is really the time  
Just finishing this brought a tear to my eye, I feel I could fly  
  
Fly high, fly high  
Fly high, fly high  
  
Fly high, fly high  
We’re tryna fly high with the birds now  
Find balance and not burn out  
(Fly high, fly high)  
Know we got it but forget it sometimes  
But we always come back with our head to the sky  
  
(Fly high, fly high)  
We’re tryna fly high with the birds now  
Find balance and not burn out  
(Fly high, fly high)  
Know we got it but forget it sometimes  
But we always come back with our head to the sky, yeah  
  
(Fly high, fly high)  
We’re tryna fly high with the birds now  
Find balance and not burn out  
(Fly high, fly high)  
Know we got it but forget it sometimes  
But we always come back with our head to the sky
