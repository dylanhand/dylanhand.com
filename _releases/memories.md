Looking back thinking them were the days  
151 rum, garlic bread as the base  
Longboarding late nights nothing anyone says  
Could ever get us to change, nah  
We're gonna stay awake 'til the dawn break  
Coming home hella late  
Mom mad 'cause I passed out half the day  
Vibe right though, we hoping that it never change  
We want to capture that feeling and get it to stay  
House parties in the hills and we gettin' faded  
Hopin' that the neighbors ain't gon' say shit  
'Cause if they do then we all gettin' busted  
We're fucked up though so we're sure we're just  
Gonna get away with stuff that we probably wouldn't otherwise  
A few times, somebody had to run from lights  
A few times, somebody had to walk a line  
But it was fine and we did it again the next night  
  
The memories I hold 'em close  
Doesn't matter how far I go  
With them I know I'm still close to home, close to home  
  
The memories I hold 'em close  
Doesn't matter how far I go  
With them I know I'm still close to home  
(yeah)  
  
Many memories made in the Music Coop  
The best record shop south pole to Nunavut  
In high school I'd cruise there when the bell rang  
And sell CD's wrapped in cellophane  
Always loved music now I'm gettin' more exposed to it  
Listening to doo-wop, soul, and the blues  
Pretty soon I'm the manager only took three or four months  
I'm sixteen got a key to the store  
One thing's for sure, the owners took care of us  
They were like a second set of cool parents  
Went from soccer games then I was trying to win  
To now the music I be diving right in and hiring friends  
Now they working there with me  
Good vibes so the time passed quickly  
Saved up a thousand dollars bought a laptop  
Did a song for class on it and the rest is history  
  
The memories I hold 'em close  
Doesn't matter how far I go  
With them I know I'm still close to home, close to home  
  
The memories I hold 'em close  
Doesn't matter how far I go  
With them I know I'm still close to home  
(yeah)  
  
Eleven years old workin' on your job site  
Construction, saving up 'cause I want a bike  
One of those rugged new ones with the Y-frame  
And shocks in the back that was my thing  
Sittin' in the driveway at 5AM  
In your white VW van with tools in the back  
Postcard on the console said "death before decaf"  
Balancing your coffee mug as you steered and hit the gas  
40 hours a week, all summer  
5th grader makin' five an hour all under  
The table you made sure I learned to value hard work  
What I wanted wasn't given; it was all earned  
'Cause of that, I'm here where I am now  
Because of that I persevere I don't stand down  
Yeah, encouraged me to put my best out  
What you taught instilled confidence I got my chest out  
  
The memories I hold 'em close  
Doesn't matter how far I go  
With them I know I'm still close to home, close to home  
  
The memories I hold 'em close  
Doesn't matter how far I go  
With them I know I'm still close to home
