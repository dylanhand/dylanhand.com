I was feeling alright I was doing just fine and I'm  
I'm looking forward to tonight  
But it's been a little while and I haven't heard a chime from ya  
Huh. Well I don't wanna read in but I'm wondering if  
You gon' really show up tonight and try to see this flick  
These days it seems that maybe like three fifths of  
These dates end up re-re-rescheduling  
And I drop another line in your DMs  
Five minutes pass, you ain't read it  
So I start swiping right tryna find someone nice that'll fix up my self esteem  
Then I talk to Tina, she said she's down to meet up  
And look here I'm a genius: invite her to the same movie  
That we were supposed to go to then we see ya  
Damn  

I got all these problems  
I'm hoping I can solve 'em now  
But when I run they're following me  
I choke when swallowing my problems yeah  

I been feeling real high then I'm so low  
Feel I'm sinking I hope that I'm gon' float  
There's a whole whole lot that I don't show but  
But I smile for the photo though  
Got all these problems they weighing me down  
I tried to square off with 'em but they staying around  
Promise I'ma keep rapping 'til I'm taking the crown  
But all the stress I ain't resting when I'm laying down  
I'm in bed always lost in my head  
Wanna sleep but my brain must think I'm playing fetch  
'cause I'm tossing instead  
Few hours every night is all that I get  
But I know it'll pay of in the end but  
I was planning to sleep  
But my mind's in the past and the future  
Awake when I have my dreams, I know  

I got all these problems  
I'm hoping I can solve 'em now  
But when I run they're following me  
I choke when swallowing my problems yeah  

I got all these problems  
I'm hoping I can solve 'em now  
But when I run they're following me  
I choke when swallowing my problems yeah  

We're done now  
Too many problems  
Good night
