Living like I got no fucks to give left  
Know that time won't wait but that shit crept  
Faster than you'd expect. Don't want to misstep  
So overthink it and done's the only thing nothing gets  
Can't be perfect, but something we strive for  
Still we're caught up tryna find a divine course  
Even though most don't yet realize you're  
Better off when you look less, you'll find more  
Try more, get less  
Buy more, temporary fix  
Too many moments spent holding it in  
Tryna control what's in their head instead of saying it with no regret  
Holy shit. Then realize that's no way to live  
I'd rather say somethin' instead of cage it in  
Life is just a game, might as well start playing it  
If you're not making mistakes you're not participating then  
So now I'm taking all these walls and breaking them  
I'ma keep doing me yeah I'm making it  
Picking up the pace to ten, make sure I hit the finish line of this shit  
I put in the time and I give 'em what's on my mind  
And they listen and then rewind it again  
If I fail, fuck it baby I'ma try it again, yeah  
I'm feeling real alive in this bitch  
Soon I'll be blowing up like a kite in the wind  
And I don't give a fuck if they try and stop me  
By the time I'm done with this they'll be tryna copy  
I keep it fly as Lockheed, yeah I'm kinda cocky  
People try but honestly they're kinda sloppy  
Not me though. I'm awfully bold  
I fuck the club up wearing a tight Speedo  
Boom! Now I got your attention you bitches better listen listen  
Ever since the beginning this been the fuckin' vision vision  
While you sittin' wishin' I came and made a decision  
It's gonna pay dividends and shit it-it ain't ever endin' endin'  
I don't think that you know  
I'm fuckin' killing it bay-buh-buh-baby I'm duh-duh-dope  
I came to wreck it every time I'm on the microphone  
And now I'm out here and you know you bitch I'm ready to go woah, woah, woah!  
I'm feeling hella beautiful, do what I wanted to do  
For so long now I gotta prove it so I can make this shit lucrative  
And then move units and these people asking who is him?  
It's Dylan Hand bitch he's coming out to ruin shit  
Yeah I'm doing this since I was in the tenth grade  
Now I'm out here and I know I'm gonna get my rent paid  
By it I'ma try at least. I had anxiety  
But killed it last year now I'm here, just tryna be  
What I can be I know it's lots, people wonder why I  
Haven't stopped I am never gonna stop going off  
So much confidence now you're all my confidants  
I'm just tryna to do this shit and never fuckin' stop  
I'm feeling great yeah I'm feeling so good  
I really want to share the feeling with everyone that I could  
Look, I'm not waiting on success, nah I already got it  
Everybody always tells you that you gotta be modest but honestly  
I just want to keep rockin' beats  
And tell these people how I feel, let my thoughts be free  
'Til the coffin creeps up I'm sharing my thoughts  
Why not? I just don't know why not  
I just wanna try, God. All I want to do is let it out  
And put the Krylon on the canvas until I'm gone  
Why not
