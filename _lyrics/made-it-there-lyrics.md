Yeah  
Okay  
Look  
Thought we were joking but we're not though  
I'm with your mom, we're sharing a plate of nachos  
Cruising through some pot holes  
Red, green, stop, go, people like he got flows  
I learned to rap way before I learned to walk bro  
Call me Ronaldo the way that I got goals  
Never gonna stop no not until I got gold  
Medals up on the wall, petals all gonna fall  
Fall into place they pumping their brakes we just  
Pumping the bass and call it a day  
Give it to 'em for free, but they wanted to pay  
And I like the arrangement, I like the arrangement  
I been this way since birth finally made this work  
All of these dreams deferred never gon' be deterred  
Coming to take my turn all of it we deserve  
I can already taste dessert  

Yeah we made it there yeah we made it there  
I don't really care I don't really care now  
Yeah we made it there yeah we made there  
And I don't really care I don't really care now  

Thought we were finished but we're not though  
Hardly started, we're far from the outro  
A few more people 'bout to watch close  
More lit than a candle the way I make the bar glow  
People basic. Me? I'm outta patience  
Tie up my laces. Why? Gotta chase it  
Got one life, not dying to waste it  
The smack talk's liberation  
I'm right there, I'm right there I can taste it  
Yeah, I used to care what they said  
Now I don't care how they take it  
If I had an enemy then we would break bread, look  
One of these days for sure I'm gonna say some words  
That are gon' make them hurt what an audacious jerk  
Gotta be making sure that it don't take a turn  
And it don't make it worse but I'm just not concerned  

Yeah we made it there yeah we made it there  
I don't really care I don't really care now  
Yeah we made it there yeah we made there  
And I don't really care I don't really care now
