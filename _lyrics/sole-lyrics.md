[Dylan Hand]  
I'm laying lazy on the couch bitch  
Im out sick so I'm not changing my outfit  
My head’s pounding, but I don't care 'cause I'm gonna stare at the TV  
I won’t dare to do anything it's true  
I'm only getting up to get some food  
The only muscle that I'll move is in my jaw to chew  
I'm hella comfortable, chillin' in a bundled wool blanket  
I just stuffed a full muffin my fucking skull  
I'm already feeling better, better than being at work  
And bending under the pressure  
So now I love being under the weather  
I do whatever I want nobody's coming to get you  
I watch another Netflix spеcial  
Some shit on how to be successful (don't lеt your dreams be dreams)  
But I'm like hell no, so I change it and find something brainless  
Some blind entertainment my mind can keep pace with  
In this state I'm in I need to bring it back to the basics  
Why's it feel so great when I stay in?  
This shit feels like a paid vacation  

[Rotaris]  
Hey, I'm a soul that's carrying a corpse  
Haven't showered in a week, but m'hands smell of soap  
My head is in a vice, feel the tightening of bolts  
They say life is real sweet, but all I taste is salt  
For now I bow down to infection  
Treat it as a point of inflection  
I cop whips by viral masters  
My throats been struck with forty lashes  
At least, I grumble with gnashed teeth  
My eyes hurt like I fell onto a glass heap  
All I have for comfort is some tea and bad sleep  
Nose keeps running like them NY city taxis  
I am woe, all my plans are all cancelled  
Head in bucket like I'm rocking those Kangols  
Each squeak or noise sounds like Lambos  
Mood takes on the form of brambles  
So I slide into backlit cuneiforms  
Escape to lands of spam and damn unicorns  
Disregard the bin of used tissues  
As the reaper pleads "let me kiss you"
