Thanks for rocking with me this last year. These numbers are almost entirely from you all sharing these first three songs, which is awesome to me.

Big thanks to [hugoville](https://open.spotify.com/artist/64n1e0DzGF4kQYeyaXJTJY?si=XqBa9EWjS0yownHI1EUVkQ), [yellowishh](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0gIGqpvEoikRkQwhZ0wCTn?si=hWbiNgKyQYy8UlHVrathBw), [RizonielTV](https://youtube.com/rizonieltv), and [Trusted Tracks](https://trustedtracks.se/) for the production, mixing, and mastering help.

Here's to more music in 2022 ðŸ•Š
