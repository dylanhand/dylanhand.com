The boys in Costa Rica were working on a new project and asked if I'd do a feature. The answer was, "of course," this is the result. Something positive with a classic sample and reggaeton inspired vibe. We recorded this in 2019 and had big plans for the release, but then the pandemic hit and the timing felt off. So here we are, pumped for it to see the light of day. What an experience it was to hop on a beat with a whole different style and collab with the people at Kindhumans.
