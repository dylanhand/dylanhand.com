title: New Song - 'Memories' featuring Haley Johnsen

My new song [Memories]({{ site.baseurl }}/memories) featuring Haley Johnsen is out now.

When I finished writing this song I knew I wanted a female vocalist to sing the chorus. I immediately thought of longtime friend [Haley Johnsen](https://www.instagram.com/haleyjohnsenmus) and Iâ€™m glad she said yes. Iâ€™ve been inspired by her musical journey for a while now and it was a breeze working together. 

Shoutout to everyone I shared late nights with back in the day for inspiring the first verse.

Shoutout to the [Music Coop](https://www.instagram.com/themusiccoop) for the coolest job and deep introduction to music during my formative years. And to everyone I worked with and met there. Second verse is for you.

And last but not least, shoutout to dad for everything. This is the verse that still gets me when I hear it. RIP and hope you hear it too.
