'Champagne' just hit ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND plays on Spotify.

Independent and $0 spent on marketing, so I know who to thank. That'd be you 🫵 and the fly ladies from Sweden's finest bocce ball team who let us interrupt their game to film an [impromptu one-take vid](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyVzR-9q7in/).

Also gotta thank Spotify who refuse to stop playing it on their radio and algorithmic playlists.

This is the sixth song I've ever released here so it's p stokeworthy to see it doing this well. Much love to you all and here's to more 🍾🥂
