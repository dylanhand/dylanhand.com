Fly High is finally here. What a ride it's been to get here. As some of you know, it's the first song I've released in several years. I'm glad to have met all the right people along the way to make it happen. I'll go into detail soon with some behind the scenes shit, but for now, let's let it speak for itself. 

Enjoy. 

-Dylan
